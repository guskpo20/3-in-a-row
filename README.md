This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe web game built using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3Ã—3 grid until one wins or the game ends in a draw.

Features:

- Two-player mode (local)

- Win and draw detection

- Game reset functionality

- Lightweight and responsive

- No frameworks or libraries used â€“ just plain JavaScript

This project was created as part of my JavaScript learning path to practice DOM manipulation, game logic, and event handling.
